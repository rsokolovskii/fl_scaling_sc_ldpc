This repository provides the code for finite-length scaling laws for SC-LDPC codes and their Monte-Carlo simulations.
It provides implementations of density evolution, mean evolution, peeling decoding, full BP decoding with and without a limit on the number of iterations, and sliding window decoding with a limit on the number of iterations.

The step-by-step guide to using the scaling laws can be found in the Jupyter notebook `sc_ldpc_scaling_bec_4_8.ipynb`.

The code in this repository is used in several papers.
Please consider citing them if you are using the code.
